# Step 1 In the array the first postion to be moved forward 2 steps
# array
# go throught the array grab the position of each element.
# Step 2 add 2 more than 2 substract 2

# beginning=[cat, dog, mouse, shoe] 
# end [mouse, shoe, cat, dog]
# a[2]mouse would be to b[0]mouse you neeed to subtact -2 

 
#  a[0]=cat +2        
#  a[1]=dog +2
#  a[2]=mouse -2
#  a[3]=shoe-2

# b[0]=mouse
# b[1]=shoe
# b[2]=cat
# b[3]=dog

# Create an n factorial function. A factorial is the evaluation of n! - This number is calculated by multiplying every number from 1 to and including n.

# this number is calucated by multiplying  every number from 1 and inclucing n.
# 7*((7-1))! is equal to 7*((6)!)
